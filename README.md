# PowerPaint
This assignment is designed to test your increasing understanding of writing graphical applications in Java. 
The key concepts are 2D graphics, mouse events, and some new Swing components. The Oracle Swing tutorial provides 
explanations and examples which may be helpful while working on this assignment.


This program is a basic version of the paint program that I built from scratch.  It has the basic drawing tools used to either draw shapes 
or freehand drawing.
